> **Project Purpose**
>
> CrossLab, funded by the Foundation for Innovation in Teaching in Higher Education,  is a German consortium project that aims to build a network of remote laboratories which are accessible for students from universities in Germany and potentially worldwide. With this, possibilities are opened up for students to experience a wider range of facilities than are available at their own institutions.
>
> The CrossLab project aims to define the **technical**, **didactic** and **organizational** solutions for open digital laboratory objects, which can be combined as required in a learning environment for student-centered teaching and learning.
>
>> **Subproject Purpose**
>>
>> The aim of English language courses at TU Bergakademie Freiberg are to extend the effectiveness of a student's knowledge and use of the English language from general contexts covered during the 8 to 10 years typically spent learning English at school to those specific to academia and to the subject area of the degree course being taken. With this in mind, the approach of the language courses in Freiberg is one of subject-sensitive language teaching.
>>
>> The purpose of the subproject is to maximize the subject-sensitivity of the language teaching by integrating remote labs into the language laboratory, that is, into the English language courses for students of STEM subjects at institutions of Higher Education.

> **Project Scope**
>
> There are four German partner universities involved in the project, each already having developed a number of remote laboratories in the fields such as engineering, chemistry, physics and computer science. The project aims to bring the operation of these remote labs onto a single platform and to develop didactic standards for their use in university courses. New remote laboratory facilities are being developed within the partner universities and eventually these resources will be available to students at other universities in Germany and across the globe.
>
>> **Subproject Scope**
>>
>> The scale of the subproject is rather small in that only one English language instructor is involved and therefore the materials and methods developed will be implemented initially in only three groups of first-year (second semester) students in the course *Introduction to English for Specific Purposes*:
>>
>> - Group 1, Robotics (ROB) and Geoinformatics/Geophysics (BGIP)
>> - Group 2, Mathematics (Mm), Business Mathematics (BWM) and Computer Science (BAI)
>> - Group 3, Chemistry (BCH and Ch)
>>
>> Implementation of the materials and methods will require 3 sessions of the summer semester. In addition to the planned implementations, the subproject will also network with external partners to assist in making the CrossLab infrastructure available to students in other countries, in particular countries in Africa.

> **Project Activities**
>
> Within the project, there are a number of working groups focussing on the technical aspects of building up a platform for the remote laboratories as well as a didactics group, which deals with the integration of the remote laboratories into university teaching. Additionally, competitions have taken place at the four partner universities, in which teaching staff can win funding to develop their own remote laboratories. For more information see the project website https://cross-lab.org/.
>
>> **Subproject Activities**
>>
>> Within the subproject, a student assistant has been hired to develop the software and hardware necessary for creating a remote lab that can be used as a test case for implementing remote labs in English lessons. For more information on this, please refer to the section on work completed.
