## Goals

    {{1}}
> ... the CrossLab project aims to define the technical, didactic and organizational solutions for open digital laboratory objects, which can be combined as required in a learning environment for student-centered teaching.

    {{2}}
> The cross in the project name stands for the interlinking of different laboratory components, media realities, as well as a cross-disciplinary and cross-university network.

    {{3}}
> In addition to the conception and implementation of a technical implementation (configuration and linking of the individual laboratory objects) and new applications in various disciplines (physics, chemistry, computer science, mechanical engineering and process engineering), the didactic concepts are further developed in order to ensure a maximum of broad integration into other subjects can.
